## About these demos

*   The Android demo base on nnapi and run on our neural chip. The Android demos are dependent on quantized tflite model.
*   The Linux demo base on adla framework interface. The demos are dependent on quantized tflite model or adla file.The adla file is compiled from tflite file. 
*   The Python-IDE demo base on pc python environment and run on our adla neural chip.The Python-IDE demos are dependent on adla file compiled from quantized tflite model.
